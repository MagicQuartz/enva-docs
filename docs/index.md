# Welcome to the EnvironmentalArmor documentation!

This page will hopefully contain all the information you need to make your own data packs for the Origins mod.

EnvironmentalArmor is a Minecraft mod which adds features and makes the various origins' lives in the Origins mod easier. It adds various items which revert the drawbacks of the origins, without removing the problem completely.

Visit [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/environmental-armor) to download the mod!

## General information

- You are welcome to join the [EnvironmentalArmor Discord server](https://discord.gg/MzKD2yq8N8) and the [Origins Discord server](https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3) if you want to talk about the mod, making data packs or add-ons for the mod, or to discover servers which use the mod which are sometimes advertised there.
- The creator of the EnvironmentalArmor, MagicQuartz, is considered no expert in Minecraft modding, Java, or anything else. Even this very wiki used the Origins wiki as an example. Thanks to Apace100, the creator of the [Origins mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) for making this wonderful mod.
- MagicQuartz is planning to make a Forge port at some point, once he learns how to make Forge mods.
