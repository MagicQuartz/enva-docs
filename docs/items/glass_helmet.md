Its in-game ID is `enva:glass_helmet`

## Obtaining

To craft the fish bowl, go to the [EnvironmentalArmor Discord server](https://discord.gg/MzKD2yq8N8) and type the command `e!recipe glass_helmet` in the bot commands channel after verifying.

## Mechanics

* The glass helmet is equippable in the player's head slot.
* Putting the glass helmet on the player's head will give them water breathing when underwater, which will give non-Merlings the ability to breathe underwater.
* The glass helmet has a counterpart for Merlings, which is the fish bowl.
* Once in The End, the player can mine and smelt titanium ore into titanium ingots, and upgrade the glass helmet into a titanium coated glass helmet.

## Downsides?

(Downsides are shared with the [Titanium Coated Glass Helmet](items/titanium_coated_glass_helmet.md))

1. Players can't stack glass helmets in their inventory.
2. While equipped, the glass helmets prevent you from putting any type of helmet on.
3. The glass helmet has 5 durability, since glass is very fragile.
4. If the glass helmet is broken when you're deep underwater and you have no spares, do your best to find/create an air source.
