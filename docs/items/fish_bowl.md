## Obtaining - Crafting

To craft the fish bowl, go to the [EnvironmentalArmor Discord server](https://discord.gg/MzKD2yq8N8) and type the command `e!recipe glass_bowl` in the bot commands channel.

## Mechanics

* If a player right clicks while looking at water with the fish bowl in its hand, the fish bowl will turn into a water fish bowl, which means it is equippable.
* Once in The End, the player can mine and smelt titanium ore into titanium ingots, and upgrade the fish bowl into a titanium coated fish bowl. This doesn't work on water fish bowls.
* The fish bowl has a counterpart for non-Merlings, which is the Glass Helmet.

## Downsides?

(Downsides are shared with the [Water Fish Bowl](items/water_fish_bowl.md))

1. Players can't stack fish bowls or water fish bowls in their inventory.
2. While equipped, the water glass bowls prevent you from putting any type of helmet on.
3. The water fish bowl has 5 durability, since glass is very fragile.
4. If the water fish bowl is taken off in the nether and you have no spares, good luck finding a water source.
